This firmware is like the one that comes with the USB Rubber Ducky but it uses the LEDs to indicate if it has finished going through an encoded DuckyScript file or not. Useful if you want a reliable way of telling when the duck has done their job.

<h3>LED indications</h3>
Red with green slightly flashing :: busy / going through the encoded DuckyScript
<br>
Flashing green :: starting; done
<br>
Red :: unable to use/access file
